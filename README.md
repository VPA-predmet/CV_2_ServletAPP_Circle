# Functionality:

User Input: Users input the radius of the circle into the provided text field on the HTML form.

Data Submission: Upon submitting the form, the entered radius value is sent to the servlet as a parameter in a GET request.

Calculation: The servlet receives the radius parameter, parses it into a numerical value, and calculates the area and perimeter of the circle using the provided radius.

Result Display: The calculated area and perimeter values are then displayed on a new webpage generated by the servlet. This webpage includes HTML markup to present the results in a readable format, typically with appropriate labels and formatting.
